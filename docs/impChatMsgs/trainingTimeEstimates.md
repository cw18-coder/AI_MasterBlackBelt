Based on your dataset (102 samples) and Llama 3.2 3B model, here are the estimated training times for different GPU configurations:

## **Training Time Estimates**

### **Your Current Setup: GTX 1660 Ti (6GB)**
- **Training time**: ~2-4 hours
- **Memory**: ~4.5-5 GB VRAM usage
- **Batch size**: 1 with gradient accumulation

### **a) Single T4 GPU (16GB)**
- **Training time**: ~45-75 minutes
- **Memory**: Can use larger batch sizes (2-4)
- **Advantages**: 
  - 2.5x faster than GTX 1660 Ti
  - More VRAM allows larger batches
  - Better memory bandwidth

### **b) Single A100 GPU (40GB/80GB)**
- **Training time**: ~15-25 minutes
- **Memory**: Can use much larger batch sizes (8-16)
- **Advantages**:
  - 8-10x faster than GTX 1660 Ti
  - Massive VRAM for large batches
  - Tensor cores optimized for AI workloads
  - Can potentially train larger models simultaneously

## **Detailed Comparison**

| GPU | VRAM | Batch Size | Est. Time | Speed vs 1660 Ti |
|-----|------|------------|-----------|------------------|
| GTX 1660 Ti | 6GB | 1 | 2-4 hours | 1x baseline |
| T4 | 16GB | 2-4 | 45-75 min | 2.5-3x faster |
| A100 40GB | 40GB | 8-12 | 15-25 min | 8-10x faster |
| A100 80GB | 80GB | 12-16 | 12-20 min | 10-12x faster |

## **Performance Factors**

### **T4 Advantages:**
- **Tensor Cores**: Hardware acceleration for mixed precision
- **Memory bandwidth**: 320 GB/s vs 288 GB/s on 1660 Ti
- **Larger batches**: More efficient gradient updates
- **Cloud availability**: Widely available on Google Colab Pro, AWS

### **A100 Advantages:**
- **3rd gen Tensor Cores**: Massive speedup for transformer training
- **Memory bandwidth**: 1,555-2,039 GB/s
- **NVLink**: If using multiple A100s
- **Sparsity support**: Can leverage model sparsity for even faster training

## **Cost Considerations**

### **Cloud Training Costs (approximate):**
- **T4**: ~$0.35/hour → ~$0.50 total training cost
- **A100**: ~$2.50/hour → ~$1.25 total training cost
- **Your laptop**: $0 (but 2-4 hours of your time)

## **Recommendations**

1. **For your 102 samples**: Your GTX 1660 Ti is perfectly adequate
2. **For scaling up**: T4 offers best price/performance ratio
3. **For production/research**: A100 if you need rapid iteration

Your current setup is actually quite efficient for this dataset size. The A100 would be overkill unless you're planning to:
- Scale to 1000+ samples
- Train multiple model variants
- Experiment with larger models (7B+)

Would you like me to create optimized training configurations for each GPU type?
