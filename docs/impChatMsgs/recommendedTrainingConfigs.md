## **Universal Training Script Template**

Would you like me to create an optimized Unsloth training script that automatically detects your GPU and applies the appropriate configuration? I can generate a script that:

1. Automatically detects available VRAM
2. Selects optimal batch size and accumulation steps
3. Applies appropriate quantization based on memory constraints
4. Converts your dataset to the required format
5. Implements early stopping and learning rate scheduling

Let me know which specific model and GPU combination you'd like to start with, and I'll provide the complete training script!
