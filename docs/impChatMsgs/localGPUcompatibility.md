I'll help you get your GPU information and assess if you can fine-tune a Llama 3.2 3B model with Unsloth on your laptop. Great! Let me also get more detailed GPU information: Perfect! Here's your GPU information:

## **Your GPU Specifications**
- **GPU**: NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1660 Ti with Max-Q Design
- **VRAM**: 6,144 MB (6 GB)
- **Current Usage**: 875 MB / 6,144 MB (about 5.3 GB available)
- **CUDA**: Version 12.9 supported
- **Driver**: 576.02 (current and compatible)

## **Fine-tuning Feasibility Assessment**

### **âœ… YES, you CAN fine-tune Llama 3.2 3B with Unsloth on your laptop!**

Here's why your setup is suitable:

### **Memory Requirements**
- **Llama 3.2 3B**: ~3.5-4 GB VRAM for inference
- **With Unsloth optimizations**: ~4-5 GB total for fine-tuning
- **Your available VRAM**: ~5.3 GB (after closing some applications)

### **Recommended Configuration**
```python
# Unsloth configuration for your GPU
max_seq_length = 512  # Shorter sequences to save memory
per_device_train_batch_size = 1  # Small batch size
gradient_accumulation_steps = 4  # Simulate larger batches
fp16 = True  # Use half precision
```

### **Optimization Tips**
1. **Close unnecessary applications** to free up VRAM
2. **Use LoRA fine-tuning** (default in Unsloth) - much more memory efficient
3. **Reduce sequence length** to 512 tokens initially
4. **Use gradient checkpointing** to trade compute for memory

### **Expected Performance**
- **Training time**: ~2-4 hours for 102 samples (3-5 epochs)
- **Memory usage**: ~4.5-5 GB VRAM
- **Batch processing**: 1 sample at a time with gradient accumulation

### **Alternative if Memory is Tight**
If you encounter memory issues, you could also fine-tune:
- **Llama 3.2 1B**: Only ~2-3 GB VRAM needed
- **Qwen2.5 1.5B**: Very efficient, ~2.5-3 GB VRAM

Your GTX 1660 Ti is actually quite capable for this task! Unsloth's optimizations make it very feasible to fine-tune 3B models on 6GB VRAM.
