Takt Time,“Takt” is German for baton or rhythm. It represents the available production time divided by customer demand to pace production at customer demand rateease.ioleantransitionsolutions.com. Takt time is a Lean calculation ensuring that products are completed at a rate that meets demand without overproduction. It’s a foundational concept for line balancing and continuous flow.,"Use in Measure/Analyze when designing or evaluating a production process.

Value Stream Mapping (VSM),"A visual mapping method to document the end-to-end process flow (material and information) for a product/service, including process times, wait times, inventory, and information flowsasq.org.

The map typically shows current state vs. future state after improvements.","Use in Define/Measure to grasp the entire process and highlight waste (especially waiting, inventory). VSM is ideal when tackling process-wide improvements that span multiple departments. It’s often one of the first steps in a Lean Six Sigma project to visualize where value is added vs. lost. After drawing a current state, use it in Analyze to pinpoint delays or excess and brainstorm a leaner future state map for Improveasq.orgleantransitionsolutions.com.","Assumes the process can be depicted in a relatively linear flow from supplier to customer (works best for manufacturing or structured service flows).

5 Whys (Root Cause Questioning),"A simple but powerful technique, originally part of Toyota’s root cause analysis approach. It involves asking “Why?” iteratively (about five times, though not a fixed rule) to drill down from a problem symptom to its underlying root causesixsigmacouncil.orgsixsigmacouncil.org. Often used in conjunction with fishbone diagrams or after identifying a particular problem area.","Use in Analyze when a problem’s cause is not immediately clear. It’s especially helpful for relatively straightforward problems where human insight can reveal the cause-and-effect chain (e.g., “Machine stopped” – Why? – “Motor failed” – Why? – “Overheated due to no coolant” – Why? – “Routine maintenance missed” – etc.). Also effective on the fly in Gemba walks or incident investigations. Team-based 5-Why sessions help get beyond blame to process factors.","Assumes that each problem has an underlying cause that can be found by sequential inquiry, and that people have knowledge of the process to answer meaningfully. It also assumes a single-chain linear logic – one cause leads to another (in reality, there may be multiple causes requiring multiple branches or iterations). No quantitative data needed, just logical consistency.","Interpret the output as the suspected root cause. The “result” of 5 Whys is typically a statement at the final Why that points to a process deficiency (often a human error or oversight, but rooted in system cause). For example, the final answer might be “Because the maintenance schedule was not followed due to lack of training.” This indicates the root cause to address is training on maintenance scheduling. The success of 5 Whys is confirmed if addressing that root cause prevents recurrence of the problem. If problems persist, it may indicate the 5-Why analysis didn’t go deep enough or missed a branch cause. Essentially, you interpret a completed 5 Why by testing whether the last “why” is actionable and systemic (if it sounds like a special one-time excuse, you likely didn’t hit root cause). In Control, absence of the problem’s recurrence is the ultimate confirmation that the true root cause was identified and fixed.",Analyze,"Yellow / Green (technique is intuitive enough for Yellow Belt; Green Belts frequently use it; Black Belts ensure it’s done thoroughly, especially for complex issues)",Six Sigma
Brainstorming & Affinity Diagram,Brainstorming is an idea-generation technique (often unstructured idea shouting or structured rounds) used throughout DMAIC when creative solutions or causes are neededicfq.orgicfq.org. An Affinity Diagram is a tool to organize a large set of ideas into logical groupings/themes by similarityicfq.org. Affinity diagrams were developed as part of the “7 Management and Planning Tools” and are used after brainstorming to make sense of many ideas (often silently grouping post-it notes of ideas by categories that emerge).,"Use brainstorming in Define (to identify potential projects or customer needs), in Analyze (to hypothesize causes for a fishbone, for example), and especially in Improve (to generate solution ideas). It’s useful whenever you need a breadth of input from team members or SMEs without immediate judgment. After a brainstorming session yields dozens of ideas (for causes or solutions), use an affinity diagram to sort and find patterns, typically in Analyze (for cause categories) or Improve (to consolidate similar solution ideas). Affinity is also used in VOC analysis to group verbatim comments into themes.","Assumes a group of people with knowledge or creativity relevant to the topic. Brainstorming assumes a non-judgmental environment where wild ideas are welcome (no filtering initially). Affinity diagram assumes that among many ideas, natural groupings exist – it may assume some level of subjectivity as people see patterns, but typically groups become evident to most, which validates the themes. No quantitative assumptions; these are qualitative tools.","Interpret brainstorming results by the quantity and variety of ideas – a successful session is indicated by a broad list of options or hypotheses. The ideas themselves are inputs for further analysis (not all will be used). With affinity grouping, interpret the clusters that form: these suggest key themes or common root causes. For example, if 30 ideas for “why delays happen” group into 5 clusters like “IT system issues,” “Training gaps,” etc., you interpret that these are major areas to address. The affinity diagram often results in labeled groups – those labels can become categories for further analysis or action workstreams. Ultimately, the result is a clearer picture of the problem or solution space. Success is when the team feels the mass of brainstormed ideas has been distilled into a few insightful categories or concepts that can be taken forward (like major cause areas to verify, or top solution themes to develop). In Control, you might not use these much, except perhaps to brainstorm control measures or response plans if something goes wrong.",Define / Analyze / Improve (brainstorming is broad use; affinity mainly Analyze/Improve),Yellow / Green (all team members participate in brainstorming; Green Belt should know how to facilitate basic sessions and affinity sorting; Black Belts might facilitate for complex or cross-functional groups),Six Sigma

After improvements, implement control charts on critical process metrics (Y’s or even key X’s) to ensure the process remains stable and within expected variation. Also use during baseline (Measure) to assess if the process was stable before; you need a stable process to compute capability. Control charts are ideal for any process that produces data sequentially (which is most processes) – manufacturing, transaction times, error counts per day, etc. Choose the type based on data: X̄–R for subgroups, I–MR for individual data, p-chart for percent defective per lot, etc.","Assumes the data is reasonably independent and from the same process (no major systematic shifts present during the period of baseline data used to set limits). Control limit calculation typically assumes a normal distribution for the averages (per Central Limit Theorem) or counts (using approximation or specific distributions for p, c charts). The classic ±3σ limits capture ~99.73% common cause if normalchegg.com. Also assumes measurement system is reliable (a basic assumption: you can trust the data – if MSA failed, control chart signals can be falseblog.minitab.com). There’s an implicit assumption that if a special cause occurs, it’s desirable and feasible to identify and eliminate it to bring process back to stable.","Interpret by checking plotted points against control rules. Primary interpretation: any point outside the control limits = signal of special cause (process likely changed at that point)icfq.org. Additionally, run tests identify non-random patterns (e.g., 7 points in a row above the mean, a trend up or down, etc. indicate shifts or drifts). If the chart is in control (no signals), interpret that the process is stable – future performance can be predicted by the current control limits (only common cause variation). If out-of-control signals appear, you must interpret them as evidence of assignable causes – investigate those points’ time period to find what happened (a machine failure? new raw material lot? etc.), then address it. Control charts essentially allow ongoing interpretation: in Control phase, the team should react to any signal. Over time, a successful Control phase is indicated by a control chart remaining in control (no violations) and hopefully maybe centered on target. For example, if the post-improve X̄ chart for cycle time shows all points within limits and randomly distributed around the mean, and no trends, you conclude the process is stable and the improvement is being maintained. If a point or trend breaks the control, that’s interpreted as a need for corrective action. In summary, control charts are interpreted as a real-time hypothesis test: Is the process the same as usual? If a chart indicates “no” (p-value of run test < 0.05, roughly), it’s time to reactquizlet.comhqontario.ca.","Control (sometimes Measure, to assess baseline stability)","Green / Black (Green Belts learn the basics of control charts for variable and attribute data; Black Belts ensure correct chart selection, limit calculation and interpretation of more complex scenarios like autocorrelation or non-normal data)",Six Sigma
Control Plan,"A documented plan describing how to monitor and maintain the improved process over timeicfq.org. It typically lists the process steps, key metrics/specs to control, methods of monitoring (control charts, inspections), measurement frequency, reaction plans if out-of-control, responsible person, and documentation updates. Often the final output of DMAIC Control phase. This concept comes from automotive quality core tools (AIAG), but is widely used in Six Sigma to hand off the process to the process owner with a sustaining plan.","Use in Control phase, at project conclusion. After implementing improvements, create a Control Plan to institutionalize them: it’s used whenever the process is running going forward. Also whenever transferring ownership from the project team to process owners, to communicate what must be done to sustain gains. In essence, it is always produced for significant improvements to prevent backsliding – a checklist of what to watch and how to respond.","Assumes that the critical process characteristics and failure modes are known (from FMEA or analysis) so they can be listed and monitored. Also assumes the organization will adhere to the plan – that operators will perform the specified checks and that management will support the reactions (the plan should be realistic and integrated into standard work). No statistical assumption here, it’s a procedural tool, but it builds on statistical controls put in place (like assuming control chart signals will be interpreted correctly as per plan).","Interpret by reviewing adherence and effectiveness: The Control Plan itself isn’t a numeric result, but its effectiveness is seen if the process remains in control and within specs over timeicfq.org. A good Control Plan clearly tells one how to detect any deviance (e.g., “measure temp each hour; if out of 150±5 range, do X”) – you interpret it by whether these instructions keep the process on target. In practice, one might audit the process against the Control Plan: if all listed monitoring and reactions are being done and the KPIs remain good, you interpret that the process is sustained. If a problem occurs and the Control Plan was followed (or perhaps not followed), that’s insight: maybe the plan needs update or retraining. Over time, fewer interventions indicate a robust process; frequent adjustments might indicate either process issue or overly tight control limits. Thus, the ultimate measure is that post-project performance (yield, sigma level, etc.) stays at the new improved level thanks to the controls in the plan.",Control,"Green / Black (Green Belts can draft control plans for their projects; Black Belts review/approve especially for complex processes, ensuring all key elements are covered.

Design of Experiments (DOE),"A systematic method for conducting controlled tests on a process to understand the effect of multiple factors (X’s) on an output (Y). DOE was formalized by R.A. Fisher and later adapted into industrial use (Box, Taguchi methods, etc.). In Six Sigma, DOE is an advanced Improve phase tool to optimize critical X’s and discover interaction effects efficientlyicfq.orgicfq.org. Common designs: full factorial, fractional factorial, and response surface (for optimization).","Use in Improve when you need to confirm cause-and-effect and optimize settings. If Analyze narrowed down a few key factors, DOE allows you to test combinations of their levels to find the optimal conditions and quantify interactions. It’s especially valuable when changes are expensive or time-consuming – DOE finds the answer in a statistically efficient way. Also used in Analyze for high-complexity processes where observational data isn’t sufficient to tease out effects. Typical scenario: “We have 4 factors that might influence defect rate; we’ll run a 2^4 factorial experiment to see which matter and what combination yields lowest defects.” In DFSS, DOE is used in the Develop stage to design robust products.","Assumes you can control the factors (at least during the experiment) and observe the results under those controlled conditions. Also assumes the system is stable enough that changes in Y can be attributed to changes in X (minimize noise factors or include them in the design). DOE designs often assume linear-additive models unless center points/curvature are included (or use RSM for quadratic fits). Requires that each trial’s outcome is independent and measurement error is relatively small (hence MSA should be done). Data from DOE is typically analyzed via ANOVA, so assumptions of normality and equal variance of residuals apply. Adequate sample size per trial is needed if high variability.","Interpret DOE results using ANOVA tables and factor effect plots. Key outcomes: p-values for each factor and interaction show significance – factors with p < 0.05 significantly affect Y. Interaction plots reveal if the effect of one factor depends on the level of another (crossing lines indicate interaction). Main effect plots and estimated coefficients show direction and magnitude – e.g., “at high temperature, average defect rate drops by 5%” etc. From this, identify the optimal combination of factor levels: often the goal is to maximize or minimize Y, so you look at the factor settings that produce the best average outcome in the trials. If using response surface methods, you might get a regression model of Y = f(X1,X2…) and contour plots to find optimal region. The success of a DOE is confirmed by confirmation runs: set factors to the predicted optimal levels and run the process – if the results match the prediction (within error), the DOE model is validated. Also, DOE may reveal interesting interactions that single-factor tests would miss. For example, “Factor A alone didn’t show big effect, but in combination with factor B at high level, it significantly improves yield” – interpret that such interaction is a critical insight to implement. Overall, DOE results guide the Improve phase implementation by pinpointing what changes will yield the best improvement in Y with statistical confidenceicfq.orgicfq.org.",Improve (occasionally late Analyze),Black / MBB (DOE is typically a Black Belt-level skill due to its complexity; Green Belts might assist in running experiments but design and analysis are done by Blacks/MBBs.

Failure Modes & Effects Analysis (FMEA),"A proactive risk analysis tool originally from reliability engineering (used in aerospace and automotive since the 1940s-1960s). FMEA systematically identifies all potential failure modes in a process or product, assesses their effects and causes, and prioritizes them by scoring Severity, Occurrence, and Detectability, typically multiplying these to get a Risk Priority Number (RPN)sixsigma-institute.org. It’s used in Six Sigma (DMAIC Analyze/Improve) to anticipate problems and decide which risks to address firstsixsigma-institute.orgsixsigma-institute.org. Variants: Process FMEA, Design FMEA, etc.","Use primarily in Analyze to identify where a process might fail and in Improve to prevent those failures. In a Lean Six Sigma project, once you have a detailed process map and perhaps some data, conduct an FMEA to pinpoint high-risk steps and inputs. It’s especially useful when designing a new process or product (DFSS) or when a process change is being made – to foresee unintended consequences. Also used in Measure (some teams do a high-level FMEA early to guide data collection towards high-risk areasisixsigma.com) and in Control (update the FMEA with actual occurrence data as a living documentisixsigma.com).","Assumes team expertise: requires cross-functional knowledge to brainstorm failures and realistic ratings. Assumes rating scales for Severity/Occurrence/Detection have been defined and are consistently applied (subjectivity can be an issue). Statistically, no strict assumptions – it’s qualitative ranking – but it assumes that higher RPN correlates with higher real risk, which is generally true if scoring is done carefully. It’s also assumed that the failure modes are independent (though in reality they may not be, the tool treats them individually).","Interpret results by looking at the RPNs (or sometimes Severity * Occurrence if using newer AIAG/VDA approaches). High RPNs (or any failure mode with very high Severity) should be addressed firstsixsigma-institute.orgsixsigma-institute.org. For example, if “failure to label product” has Severity 8, Occurrence 5, Detection 4, RPN = 160, whereas “minor cosmetic flaw” is 2/3/2 = 12, the former is a priority to fix. The FMEA output is a list of recommended actions for high-risk failure modes – interpret a successful FMEA as one that leads the team to implement controls or improvements that lower those risks (and then the FMEA is updated with new, lower Occurrence or better Detection scores)isixsigma.com. In Control, if a failure mode did occur, revisit the FMEA: was its RPN underestimated or did the action not work? Over time, if no high-severity failures happen and overall process risk is reduced, that validates the FMEA. Essentially, you interpret an FMEA by using it as a map of where to focus preventive efforts – the numeric scores guide this focusisixsigma.comisixsigma.com.",Analyze / Improve (and revisited in Control),"Green / Black (Green Belts can participate in FMEAs and often initiate them for moderate projects; Black Belts or process engineers lead FMEAs, especially for complex processes or DFSS, to ensure consistency and follow-up)",Six Sigma
Fishbone Diagram (Ishikawa Cause-and-Effect),"A diagrammatic root cause analysis tool introduced by Dr. Kaoru Ishikawa in the 1960s. It organizes potential causes of a problem into categories (commonly 6Ms: Machine, Method, Materials, Man (People), Measurement, Mother Nature (Environment)) and sub-causes branching off the “spine” like fishbonessixsigma-institute.orgsixsigma-institute.org. It provides a structured brainstorm of possible causes leading to an effect (problem) at the “head” of the fish.","Use in Analyze for structured brainstorming of root causes. Particularly valuable when a problem’s causes are complex or multifaceted. In a team setting, after defining the problem (effect), use a fishbone to exhaustively list potential causes under category headingssixsigma-institute.org. It’s often used prior to data collection or experiments, to ensure all hypotheses are considered. Also used in conjunction with 5 Whys (you might 5-Why the major branches).","Assumes causes can be meaningfully categorized and that the team involved has process knowledge to contribute ideas. It’s qualitative – no data needed to populate initially – but assumes that among the listed causes are the true root causes. The categories (6M, 5M+E, or other frameworks) assume the problem can be dissected that way; this helps completeness but isn’t statistical.","Interpret the diagram by reviewing all the potential causes identified and then prioritizing some for verification (e.g., through data or observation). The fishbone itself doesn’t output “the answer” – it outputs a set of hypotheses. So interpreting results means identifying which few causes appear most plausible or have the biggest impact (sometimes marked with an affinity or voting by the team). For instance, the team might mark three causes on the diagram as most likely contributors to a defect. The next step is to gather data to confirm those. In terms of usefulness, a fishbone is successful if it broadened the team’s perspective and captured less obvious causes (not just the first guess). In Control, you might revisit the fishbone to ensure all major causes have been addressed by solutions or mistake-proofing, interpreting success as no major unaddressed branch remaining and seeing problem metrics improve.",Analyze,Yellow / Green (a fundamental quality tool taught by Green Belt level; Black Belts facilitate for more complex or cross-functional problems),Six Sigma
Force Field Analysis,"A change management tool developed by Kurt Lewin. It visualizes and analyzes forces driving movement toward a goal (helping forces) and forces restraining movement (hindering forces). In a diagram, one lists driving forces on one side, restraining on the other, and considers their strength to decide how to strengthen or weaken forces for change.","Use in Improve, especially when implementing solutions that will require buy-in or encountering resistance. For example, if you plan to implement a new process, do a Force Field Analysis to brainstorm what factors will help adoption (e.g., management support, clear benefits) and what factors will resist it (e.g., worker habit, additional effort, cost) and then plan actions to amplify the drivers and mitigate the resistors. It’s also useful in the Define phase if you’re scoping a project and anticipating challenges, or in Control when handing off, to ensure sustaining forces stay stronger than slipping forces.","Assumes change has both positive and negative pressures that can be identified by the team. Relies on subjective assessment of force “strength” – assumes team can estimate which are big vs small influences. No numerical data needed, but it helps to be evidence-based (e.g., “past similar change failed due to X” is a restraining force with known history).","Interpret the analysis by the list and relative weighting of forces. Typically, you might score each force 1 to 5 on strength. If restraining forces outweigh driving forces, interpretation is that change is at risk – so one must strategize to either add more driving forces or reduce restrainers. For instance, if a strong restraining force is “High training burden,” you might counter that by adding a driving force “Simplify the process or provide extra training resources.” The outcome of Force Field Analysis is an action plan: you interpret which forces are most critical and then decide to bolster or reduce them. In terms of results, you’d evaluate success by seeing the change implemented successfully (which implies the analysis was correct and forces were managed). If the project stalls or faces unexpected resistance, it may indicate the analysis missed a force or underweighted something. So it’s an upfront diagnostic and planning tool – interpreted by qualitatively assessing balance of change dynamics, and practically by whether those dynamics are addressed in your implementation plan.",Improve (implementation planning); Control (sustaining change),"Green / Black (Green Belts can do this with their teams for smaller changes; Black Belts use it for larger-scale changes or to coach Greens on stakeholder analysis.

Histogram,"Another basic quality tool – a graphical representation of the distribution of a continuous data set, showing frequency of data points in specified bins (intervals). Helps visualize data spread, central tendency, and shape (e.g., normality, skewness, multimodal).","Use in Measure and Analyze to understand the distribution of process performance data (cycle times, part dimensions, transaction values, etc.). For example, plot a histogram of cycle time to see variation and if it meets customer spec. It’s particularly useful when you suspect variation or want to check if data is approximately normal for statistical tests. Also after improvements, a histogram can show reduced variation.","Assumes you have continuous or count data that can be meaningfully grouped into ranges. Requires a reasonable sample size for a meaningful shape. Underlying many Six Sigma stats is a normality assumption, and a histogram is often used to visually assess that (though more formally with normality tests)scribd.com. (If data is too little, histogram might be misleading.)","Interpret by the shape and spread: e.g., a bell-shaped (normal) histogram indicates a stable process around the mean, while a skewed histogram might indicate a non-normal process or some boundary (like a spec limit). Check the range against specification limits if applicable – e.g., a histogram can be annotated with LSL/USL to see percent out of spec. If there are multiple peaks, interpret that as potential different subgroups (stratification needed). Post-improvement, you’d expect a histogram to become narrower (reduced variance) or centered closer to target. In short, the histogram tells you how your process varies – its success as a tool is in revealing patterns like wide variation or outliers that prompt further analysis or action.",Measure / Analyze,"Yellow / Green (taught as one of 7 QC tools; by Green Belt, one should be able to create and interpret basic histograms)",Six Sigma
Hypothesis Testing (Statistical Inference),"A collection of statistical tests (t-test, ANOVA, chi-square, etc.) used in Six Sigma to objectively evaluate differences or effects. Grounded in classical statistics, hypothesis testing allows teams to confirm whether observed differences are real or due to chance, by computing p-values. Six Sigma heavily emphasizes data-driven decisions in Analyze: e.g., two-sample t-tests for means, ANOVA for multiple means, proportion tests, chi-square for independence, etc., all structured under null/alternative hypotheses.","Use in Analyze to validate or reject suspected causes or to compare before vs after improvements. For example: Is the mean cycle time different on the day vs night shift? (two-sample t-test); Do different machine settings yield different defect rates? (chi-square or proportion test); Which factor levels significantly affect yield? (ANOVA). Also used in Improve to verify a selected solution yields statistically significant improvement. Essentially, whenever you need to make a yes/no determination from sample data, use the appropriate hypothesis test.","Assumes underlying statistical conditions depending on test: e.g., t-test/ANOVA assume approximate normality of the metric and similar variances between groupsscribd.com; chi-square assumes sufficient expected frequencies; all tests assume samples are random and independent. Many Six Sigma tests assume data is normal or can be transformed – hence normality test is often donescribd.com. If assumptions (like normality) are violated, non-parametric tests (Mann-Whitney, Kruskal-Wallis, etc.) might be used.","Interpret by the p-value in comparison to a significance level (α, usually 0.05). A p-value ≤ 0.05 leads you to reject the null hypothesis, concluding there is a statistically significant effect/differencemhc-net.com. For example, p = 0.01 in a t-test comparing old vs new process means would mean you have 99% confidence the means differ – thus the improvement is real, not chance. If p > 0.05, you fail to reject null, meaning no significant evidence of difference (e.g., “Factor A does not significantly affect outcome” at 95% confidence). Additionally, confidence intervals should be interpreted: they provide the range of plausible values for differences or proportions, which is important for practical significance. The results of hypothesis tests should be linked back to practical terms: e.g., “We are 95% confident the new method saves between 1.5 and 2.0 minutes per transaction on averageicfq.org.” In summary, success is using statistical evidence to make decisions – e.g., choosing which X’s truly impact Y or confirming an improvement’s effect. (In Control, hypothesis tests might verify sustained improvement, or equivalently control charts do continuous hypothesis testing for stability.)","Analyze (primary), Improve (to verify improvement)","Green / Black (Green Belts learn basic tests like 2-sample t, chi-square; Black Belts handle more complex designs: ANOVA with blocking, non-parametrics, etc., and ensure assumptions are met)",Six Sigma
Measurement System Analysis (MSA) – Gage R&R,"A statistical tool to assess the quality of the data measurement process. Gage Repeatability and Reproducibility (R&R) is a key component: it quantifies measurement variation coming from the instrument (repeatability) and different operators (reproducibility)scribd.comscribd.com. MSA also includes assessing bias, linearity, stability of measurement devices. Ensures data collected for Six Sigma is trustworthy.","Use in Measure phase before collecting lots of data for analysis. Whenever your project deals with measurements (dimensions, lab tests, transactional timestamps, survey ratings, etc.), perform an MSA to confirm the measurement error is small relative to process variation. Especially critical if data comes from gauges or human inspectors.

Nominal Group Technique (NGT) & Multi-Voting,"These are decision-making tools used to prioritize or converge on options after brainstorming. NGT involves individuals ranking options, then aggregating rankings to ensure balanced input (often after discussion)asq.org. Multi-voting (aka N/3 voting) is a quicker method where each team member gets a fixed number of votes (like dots or checks) to distribute among options, and the options with the most votes are chosen for further considerationasq.org. The goal is to avoid groupthink and ensure a fair, democratic selection of ideas.","Use in Analyze or Improve after generating a list of items (causes or solutions) and when you need to narrow down to the most important ones. For example, if you brainstormed 20 potential causes, use multi-voting to have the team vote for the top 3 causes they believe are most likely; the ones with the highest votes will be investigated first. Similarly in Improve, if you have many solution ideas, use NGT or multi-vote to select the most promising few to pilot. Use NGT when you want to ensure equal voice (it often has a round-robin sharing of rankings) and reduce bias from loud voices or hierarchy.",Assumes participants understand the options well enough to make an informed vote or ranking. It also assumes the “wisdom of crowds” – that the collective prioritization will surface good choices (which is generally effective especially if the group has diverse knowledge). Needs facilitator to ensure fairness (especially for NGT steps). No data assumptions – it’s a group decision tool.,"Interpret results by the final ranked list or vote counts. For multi-voting, the output might be, say, “Out of 10 solutions, the top 3 by vote count are A, B, and C – these will be pursued.” The interpretation is straightforward: higher vote count = perceived higher importance/feasibility (whatever criteria you set, usually impact on problem vs ease/cost). If using weighted criteria, you might produce a score for each option (like Pugh matrix or decision matrix variant); interpret those scores similarly – higher score = preferred option. The key is that the team has now agreed on a focus. The success of this tool is seen if the team buys into the result and it indeed focuses efforts on the right things. In retrospect (Control phase), if the chosen causes were validated or the chosen solutions yielded improvement, then the group’s prioritization was correct. If not, maybe an important item was under-rated, prompting a revisit. But generally, these techniques add transparency: you can interpret not only what was picked but also gauge consensus (e.g., if one option had 90% of votes, there was strong agreement, versus a split vote which might need re-evaluation or combining options).",Analyze (prioritize root causes to tackle); Improve (select solutions to implement),"Green (Green Belts typically facilitate multi-voting or NGT in their teams; Yellow team members participate.

Pareto Chart (80/20 Analysis),"One of the basic quality tools; Vilfredo Pareto’s principle was adapted by Juran to quality: typically, ~80% of problems come from ~20% of causes. A Pareto chart is a bar chart sorted descending by frequency or impact, often with a cumulative percentage lineicfq.org. It helps isolate the “vital few” from the “trivial many.”","Use in Analyze to prioritize which causes or defects to tackle first. Whenever you have categorical data of occurrences (defect types, complaint types, causes of delay, etc.), use a Pareto chart to see which categories are most significant. Also used in Measure to display baseline defect breakdown, and in Control to monitor that major causes remain addressed.

For example, you might find 3 causes account for 80% of defects – focusing on those should yield big gains. The chart’s shape indicates how steep the drop-off is: a sharp drop after the first few bars means a classic Pareto situation. If the bars are more uniform, there is no clear Pareto dominance (tackling any single cause might not dramatically improve things). In practice, success is when you address the top causes and then a new Pareto (in Control) shows those have diminished and maybe new factors now dominate (or overall defects have fallen).",Analyze (also Measure for baseline),Yellow / Green (basic analysis tool taught early; Green Belts use it regularly; Black Belts ensure proper data for it),Six Sigma
"Process Capability Analysis (Cp, Cpk)","A statistical assessment of how well a process can meet specification limits. Cp (Capability) assumes the process is centered and measures spread relative to specs (=(USL–LSL)/6σ). Cpk (Capability Index) accounts for centering by measuring distance of mean to nearest spec in sigma unitsscribd.comscribd.com. Also Pp/Ppk for performance (using actual, not within, deviation). These indices come from statistical process control and were popularized in Six Sigma to quantify baseline and improved capability (with Six Sigma aiming for Cpk ~2 for 0.5 defect per million).","Use in Measure to quantify baseline capability (e.g., “Our process has Cpk = 0.8, not meeting spec consistently”). Also in Control to verify the improved process capability. Anytime you have continuous data with specs (manufacturing dimensions, delivery time against a target SLA, etc.), calculate Cp/Cpk to see if the process is capable of meeting customer requirements. It’s especially critical when defect levels need to be quantified and communicated in Sigma terms.","Assumes a stable (in statistical control) process and usually that the data is approximately normally distributed (capability formulas assume normality for defect estimation). Also assumes you have defined specification limits (LSL/USL) from customer or design. If the process is not stable or data not normal, capability indices can be misleadingprojects.itrcweb.org.","Interpret by the numeric values: Cp compares spread to tolerance – Cp < 1 means process spread is wider than spec range (inherent variability too high), Cp = 1 means barely meets specs if centered, Cp > 1 means process has potential capability if centered. Cpk indicates actual capability accounting for centering – if Cpk < 1, process is not meeting specs (lots of defects); Cpk = 1 means ~2700 ppm defects (3.0 Sigma level); Cpk ~1.33 is often a minimum goal (~4 Sigma, ~64 ppm); Cpk = 2 is world-class (~6 Sigma, 0.0019 ppm). The difference between Cp and Cpk reveals centering issues (if Cp >> Cpk, the process average is off-center). After improvements, you’d expect Cpk to increase, showing fewer defects. For example, if baseline Cpk was 0.8 (significant defects), and after reducing variation and centering, Cpk is 1.4, interpretation is the process can now reliably meet specs with some cushion. In practical terms, you’d also translate Cpk into expected defect rates (or yield) to make a case for improvement or verify success.","Measure (baseline); Analyze (to assess potential, especially Cp); Control (verify improved capability)",Green / Black (Green Belts learn basic capability analysis; Black Belts handle cases with non-normal data or advanced indices),Six Sigma

It originated in Japan (1970s) for product design, later adopted in Six Sigma (especially DFSS) to ensure VOC is rigorously turned into CTQs and design specs.","Use primarily in Define for product or process design projects (DMADV or DFSS). In a DMAIC context, QFD can be useful in Improve if you are redesigning a process or developing features as part of a solution. For example, if improving a service, use QFD to link customer desires (like “short wait time”, “friendly service”) to specific process changes or control metrics. It’s most beneficial when the relationship between customer needs and possible design solutions is complex and you want to prioritize design efforts that have the biggest impact on what customers value.","Assumes you have clear VOC data and a set of potential design parameters. Requires scoring the relationships (usually 0-1-3-9 for none/weak/medium/strong) – this is somewhat subjective, so it assumes a knowledgeable team or data to support impact estimates. Also assumes linearity (scores additive) in a sense for calculating importance of design features. It’s quite qualitative/structured – no statistical assumption, but consistency and clarity in scoring is key.","Interpret the House of Quality matrix by looking at which design requirements (HOWs) have the highest weighted importance (based on how much they contribute to high-priority customer needs)asq.org. Those become the focus – e.g., if “on-time delivery” is a top customer need and it has strong relationships with design features “real-time tracking system” and “optimized scheduling”, then those features get high importance scores. The outcome is a ranked list of what technical/process requirements to implement to satisfy customers. Also, the “roof” of the house (HOWs correlation) tells you if some design features aid or conflict with each other – interpret that to ensure solutions are synergistic (or address trade-offs). For example, if one feature improves one need but hurts another, you see a conflict symbol – then you must innovate a way to resolve that. The success of QFD is seen when the final design or process truly meets customer needs better than before, as evidenced by improved customer satisfaction or metrics aligned to those needs. If implemented solutions trace back to high-priority VOC and those CTQs are improved, you interpret that QFD led to a customer-driven design.",Define (especially DFSS); Improve (for design of solution features),"Black / MBB (QFD/House of Quality is detailed and often beyond standard Green Belt curriculum. Black Belts or DFSS Black Belts lead QFD sessions with cross-functional teams; Green Belts may contribute VOC data or assist, but full QFD typically by more advanced practitioners due to the thoroughness and time required.)",Six Sigma
Regression Analysis (Predictive Modeling),"A statistical modeling technique to quantify the relationship between one or more independent variables (X’s) and a dependent variable (Y). In Six Sigma, simple linear regression might relate one X to Y; multiple regression handles multiple X’s. It provides an equation Y = f(X) + error, with coefficients indicating the impact of each X. Key outputs include coefficients, p-values (significance of each factor), and R-squared (percentage of variation in Y explained by the model)icfq.org6sigma.us. Regression is central in Analyze when searching for causal relationships and in Improve for prediction/optimization (and is the backbone of DOE analysis as well).","Use in Analyze when you have continuous data and want to understand/predict Y based on X’s. For example: how does temperature and pressure together affect yield? (multiple regression) or can we predict call handle time from customer type? (perhaps simple regression or ANOVA). Use it after initial correlation or scatter plots indicate relationships. It’s especially useful when you suspect several factors jointly influence an outcome and you need to quantify each one’s effect. Also used to validate which X’s matter most (those with significant coefficients). In Improve, you might use regression equations to set factor levels for optimal Y (short of doing a full DOE optimization).","Assumes a specific model form (usually linearity in parameters). Standard regression assumes: linear relationship between X and Y (though you can include transforms or polynomial terms), residuals (errors) are normally distributed, independent, and have constant variance (homoscedasticity). It also assumes X variables aren’t too highly correlated with each other (multicollinearity can distort results). Data should be free of outliers or they should be handled separately. Adequate sample size is needed relative to number of predictors.","Interpret by examining R-squared and p-values of coefficients. R-squared tells how much of Y’s variability is explained by the model (e.g., R² = 0.85 means 85% of variation in Y is explained by the X’s in the model – a strong fit)6sigma.us. Adjusted R² is used for multiple regression to account for number of predictors. Coefficient p-values indicate if each X has a statistically significant effect on Y (p ≤ 0.05 typically means yes). Significant coefficients’ signs and magnitudes show the direction and strength of impact (e.g., “for each additional degree of temperature, yield increases by 0.5% on average, p<0.01”). Also look at residual plots: randomness implies the model is adequate; patterns imply model misspecification (maybe a non-linear effect or omitted variable). Once validated, use the regression equation to predict outcomes – interpretation is making reliable predictions within the data range. For instance, if regression shows factor A and B are significant, you’d focus improvements on controlling A and B to influence Y. If R² is low, you interpret that the model doesn’t capture much – maybe important X’s are missing or process is too noisy. In summary, regression’s result is both understanding (which X’s matter and how) and a predictive tool; its success is measured by how well it can explain/predict and thus guide improvement decisions6sigma.usicfq.org.",Analyze (extensively); Improve (for confirming and predicting impact of changes),"Black (Green Belts might do simple linear regression, but multiple regression and proper assumptions checking are typically Black Belt level skills; MBBs may assist in complex modeling or when data doesn’t meet assumptions)",Six Sigma
SIPOC Diagram,"A high-level process mapping tool standing for Suppliers, Inputs, Process, Outputs, Customers. It comes from Total Quality Management and was adopted into Six Sigma’s Define phase to scope projectsicfq.orgicfq.org. It provides a one-page view of a process’s boundaries and key elements before diving into details.","Use at the very start (Define phase) to understand and communicate the process under study. Ideal when launching a project to ensure the team agrees on project scope: what process is in scope, who provides inputs, what outputs are delivered, and to whom. Also useful whenever team members or stakeholders need a common understanding of the process contexticfq.orgicfq.org.",Assumes the process can be defined in terms of clear inputs and outputs and has identifiable suppliers and customers. Requires consensus on process boundaries (which steps are included). It’s a qualitative tool – no data assumptions.,"Interpret by reviewing completeness and alignment: a good SIPOC clearly lists all critical inputs and outputs and helps spot any gaps (e.g., missing supplier for an input). The result isn’t a numeric output but ensures everyone “is on the same page.” If the SIPOC is well-defined, subsequent analyses (like CTQ, process mapping) will be based on a correct understanding. Any confusion or scope creep later suggests the SIPOC needed revision.",Define,Yellow / Green (basic tool known at all levels; typically facilitated by Green Belt or higher),Six Sigma
Scatter Plot (Scatter Diagram),A basic tool to study relationships between two variables. Each point represents one observation’s X (independent variable) and Y (dependent variable) valuesasq.orgasq.org. Often used to see if changes in X correspond with changes in Y (correlation).,"Use in Analyze when exploring potential X–Y relationships (e.g., does temperature affect cycle time? Does training hours relate to error rate?). It’s particularly useful before more formal regression: a scatter plot can visually reveal correlation, outliers, or non-linear patterns. Also used in DOE analysis to visualize interactions or in Control to monitor paired metrics (like volume vs. defect count over time).","Assumes you have paired numerical data for each observation. No distribution assumption for the plot itself (it’s non-parametric visualization), but underlying correlation assumes roughly linear relationship if you plan to quantify it with Pearson’s r. If data has different regimes, scatter might need stratification. Also assumes sufficient sample to see a pattern.","Interpret by the pattern of points: if they trend upward from left to right, that indicates a positive correlation (as X increases, Y tends to increase); downward trend indicates negative correlationicfq.orgicfq.org. If points are very loosely scattered with no clear pattern, likely little to no correlation. The strength of clustering suggests how strong the relationship is – a tight line vs a cloud. Outliers can be spotted as points far from the main cluster, which might warrant investigation. In Six Sigma, interpreting a scatter might lead you to run a regression or at least calculate the correlation coefficient to confirm. Essentially, the scatter plot’s result is a visual hypothesis: “X and Y seem related (or not).” If, for example, you see a strong relationship, you’d interpret that changes in X might be causing changes in Y and focus further analysis there. If no relationship, you might deprioritize that X.",Analyze,"Green (basic tool by Green Belt level, though even Yellow may do simple scatter charts; Black Belt for advanced correlation/regression analysis)",Six Sigma
Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs),"Detailed written instructions to document and standardize how each process task should be performed. SOPs ensure everyone follows the same steps, which is vital for maintaining quality and consistencyicfq.org. In the context of Lean Six Sigma, updating or creating SOPs is often part of the Control phase to lock in the improved method. They are an element of standard work (lean) and part of knowledge management.","Use in Control to institutionalize process changes. After improvements, create or revise SOPs so that the new process steps are clearly described. Also use whenever variability in human work is contributing to defects – a well-written SOP (with input from users) can reduce variation. Any time training a new operator is needed, an SOP provides the baseline. For example, if a DMAIC project improved a call handling process, an SOP document for the new call script and process is prepared for all agents.","Assumes process steps can be clearly codified in a procedure (some creative or highly variable tasks are harder to SOP). Also assumes users will actually follow the SOP – which requires that it’s practical, accessible, and management enforces its use (possibly via training and periodic audits). No statistical assumptions, but effective SOPs often assume a relatively stable process (if process changes frequently, SOP needs continual updates).","Interpret results by consistency and compliance: If SOPs are effective, you’d see reduced variation in how tasks are performed (which translates to more stable output metrics). One can measure compliance via audits or observations – high compliance rates indicate the SOP is being used. Ultimately, if the process metric stays improved (e.g., defect rate remains low) and there’s little variation shift operator-to-operator or shift-to-shift, it suggests the SOPs (plus training) have standardized the work. If issues reoccur, check if SOP was not followed or if SOP needs improvement. So the “result” of an SOP is not numerical but is seen in sustaining the gains: stable control charts, no increase in defects, etc. Over a longer term, consistent SOP use often allows further improvements (kaizen) because the process noise is lower.",Control,"Green / Black (Green Belts often update/create SOPs for processes they improved; Black Belts ensure the SOP covers critical inputs and steps identified in FMEA, etc. and ties into training materials. Ultimately, process owners maintain SOPs)",Six Sigma
Voice of the Customer (VOC) & CTQ Tree,"VOC is the process of capturing customer needs and feedback (through interviews, surveys, complaints, etc.) and translating them into requirements. Critical-to-Quality (CTQ) Trees take VOC data and break down high-level needs into specific, measurable CTQs (metrics). Origin in quality function deployment (QFD) and Six Sigma’s customer-centric approachasq.org.","Use in Define to ensure the project is focused on what matters to customers. Start with VOC gathering when defining the problem or improvement opportunity (e.g., through surveys or focus groups). Then create a CTQ tree to translate a broad need (“improve delivery”) into CTQs (e.g., on-time delivery %, package condition, etc.) with specific targets. Also used in Design for Six Sigma (DMADV) to design products/processes to customer specsasq.org.","Assumes customers can articulate needs (or that latent needs can be inferred) and that historical VOC data is available or can be obtained. Also assumes a need can be quantified as CTQs – requires careful translation. For CTQs, assumes a stable relationship: improving the CTQ metric improves customer satisfaction.","Interpret VOC by identifying priority themes or pain points (e.g., top complaints or desired features). For CTQs, interpret the tree by verifying that lower-level CTQs (metrics) indeed drive the higher-level need. Success is seen when CTQ targets are met and customer satisfaction improves. In practice, if a CTQ is, say, “delivery in ±1 day of promised date 95% of time,” then achieving that should reflect in fewer customer complaints about delivery. The CTQ tree results in clear, actionable specs – its effectiveness is confirmed in Control phase if meeting those spec targets correlates with happy customersasq.orgisixsigma.com.",Define (VOC capture & CTQ definition),Green / Black (Green Belts often gather VOC for projects; Black Belts for complex VOC analysis or QFD matrices),Six Sigma
